# Testing System - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Live Monitoring Not Showing Students
**Problem**: Admin couldn't see students in Live Monitoring dashboard.

**Root Cause**:
- Component relied on custom SQL function `get_live_test_monitoring()`
- Function may not have been created or had permission issues

**Solution**:
- Replaced RPC call with direct Supabase queries
- Now uses joins between `test_editor_sessions` and `profiles` tables
- Manually merges submission data for complete view
- More reliable and debuggable

**Changed File**: `src/components/test/LiveMonitoringGrid.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Student Submission Errors
**Problem**: Console errors when students submitted tests or triggered alt-tab warnings.

**Root Causes**:
- Trying to update `suspicious_activity_log` as nested JSON object (not supported directly)
- No error handling on database updates
- Missing session creation when resuming tests

**Solutions**:
- Removed complex JSON updates for `suspicious_activity_log`
- Simplified to only update scalar fields (`alt_tab_count`, `paste_attempt_count`)
- Added proper error handling with console logging
- Added session creation check when resuming tests

**Changed Files**:
- `src/components/test/SecureCodeEditor.tsx`
- `src/components/test/StudentTestView.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ View Submissions Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking "View Submissions" did nothing - just console logged.

**Root Cause**:
- Feature was stubbed out with `console.log()`
- No actual UI implementation

**Solution**:
- Created full-featured `SubmissionsViewer` component
- Features:
  - Table view of all submissions for a test
  - View individual student code
  - Grade submissions (score + feedback)
  - See violation counts (alt-tabs, paste attempts)
  - Status badges (in_progress/submitted/graded)
- Integrated into `TestManagement` component

**New File**: `src/components/test/SubmissionsViewer.tsx`
**Changed File**: `src/components/test/TestManagement.tsx`

## Testing Checklist

### For Admins:
- [x] Create a test
- [x] Open the test
- [ ] **TO TEST**: Verify test appears in student view
- [ ] **TO TEST**: Check Live Monitoring shows students when they start
- [ ] **TO TEST**: Send intervention message to student
- [ ] **TO TEST**: View submissions and grade a student

### For Students:
- [x] Start a test
- [x] Code saves automatically
- [ ] **TO TEST**: Alt-tab triggers warning
- [ ] **TO TEST**: Copy-paste is blocked
- [ ] **TO TEST**: Receive intervention messages
- [x] Submit test successfully

## Known Limitations & Notes

### Database Schema
The `suspicious_activity_log` field exists but is not currently being populated due to Supabase update limitations. This field was designed to store detailed logs as:
```json
[
  {"type": "alt_tab", "timestamp": "...", "count": 1},
  {"type": "paste_attempt", "timestamp": "...", "count": 1}
]
```

However, Supabase doesn't support appending to JSONB arrays in a simple UPDATE. Options:
1. **Current approach**: Use scalar counters (`alt_tab_count`, `paste_attempt_count`)
2. **Future enhancement**: Use separate `activity_logs` table for detailed tracking
3. **Advanced**: Use Postgres functions to append to JSONB arrays

### Real-time Performance
- Live Monitoring polls every 5 seconds as fallback
- Real-time subscriptions may have delays with many concurrent students
- Recommended max: 20-30 students per test session

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing Required:
1. **Run the SQL migration** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor
   # Paste contents of: supabase/migrations/test-system.sql
   ```

2. **Enable Realtime** in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Database → Replication
   - Enable for: `test_editor_sessions`, `test_admin_interventions`, `test_submissions`

3. **Test the flow**:
   ```
   Admin: Create test → Open test → Monitor
   Student: Start test → Write code → Submit
   Admin: View submission → Grade → Save
   ```

### Suggested Improvements:
- [ ] Add batch grading (grade multiple students at once)
- [ ] Export submissions to CSV
- [ ] Test analytics (average score, violation rates)
- [ ] Auto-grading with test case execution
- [ ] Email notifications when tests are graded
- [ ] Submission comparison (plagiarism detection)

## Debug Tips

### If students don't appear in Live Monitoring:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify student has `test_editor_sessions` entry:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM test_editor_sessions WHERE test_id = 'YOUR_TEST_ID';
   ```
3. Check RLS policies allow admin to view sessions
4. Ensure student started test (not just viewing)

### If auto-save fails:
1. Check browser Network tab for failed requests
2. Verify RLS policies on `test_submissions`
3. Check student has active submission record
4. Look for console errors in `SecureCodeEditor`

### If submissions viewer is empty:
1. Verify test has submissions:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM test_submissions WHERE test_id = 'YOUR_TEST_ID';
   ```
2. Check RLS policies allow admin to SELECT
3. Ensure foreign key to profiles is correct

## Files Modified in This Fix

1. `src/components/test/LiveMonitoringGrid.tsx` - Direct queries instead of RPC
2. `src/components/test/SecureCodeEditor.tsx` - Simplified updates, error handling
3. `src/components/test/StudentTestView.tsx` - Session creation on resume
4. `src/components/test/TestManagement.tsx` - Submissions viewer integration
5. `src/components/test/SubmissionsViewer.tsx` - **NEW** - Full grading UI
