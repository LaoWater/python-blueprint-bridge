⚔️ Idea 1: “The Warrior’s Helmet”

Scene: A medieval battlefield, a fierce voivode (in full armor) raises his sword, ready to charge.

Scene: He suddenly stops, puts down his helmet, and sits cross-legged in the mud as arrows fly past.

Punch-line: Voiceover: “Even the strongest warriors need a moment to breathe. Therapy is your armor off the battlefield.” → [terapie-acasa.ro]

🔨 Idea 2: “The Blacksmith’s Burden”

Scene: A blacksmith is furiously hammering a sword on the anvil. Sparks fly, sweat pours, the sound is intense.

Scene: He pauses, stares at the metal, and instead of forging, he just rests his forehead on the hammer, exhausted.

Punch-line: On screen text: “Not every battle is fought with iron. Some are inside. Talk it out.” → [terapie-acasa.ro]

🌾 Idea 3: “Village Gossip, 1450 Edition”

Scene: A group of peasants in traditional clothing whisper and giggle near a well, clearly gossiping.

Scene: One villager walks away, head low, overwhelmed by the murmurs.

Punch-line: Narrator: “People have always talked. Therapy helps you write your own story.” → [terapie-acasa.ro]

🏰 Idea 4: “The King’s Council”

Scene: A medieval ruler sits at a long wooden table, his advisors yelling over each other, waving scrolls and maps.

Scene: The ruler slams his goblet down and shouts: “Enough! I need silence!” Everyone freezes.

Punch-line: Narrator: “Your mind can feel like a noisy council. Therapy helps you find your voice.” → [terapie-acasa.ro]

🗡️ Idea 5: “The Duel Within”

Scene: Two identical knights (like a mirror) duel fiercely in slow motion, sparks flying from clashing swords.

Scene: Both collapse at the same time, exhausted, removing helmets to reveal the same face.

Punch-line: On screen text: “Sometimes the hardest fight is with yourself. You don’t have to fight alone.” → [terapie-acasa.ro]
