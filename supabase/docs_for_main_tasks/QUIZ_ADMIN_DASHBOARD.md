## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

**Results Viewer:**
```typescript
// Get all attempts with user and quiz info
.from('quiz_attempts')
.select(`
  *,
  profiles!quiz_attempts_user_id_fkey(username),
  quizzes!quiz_attempts_quiz_id_fkey(title, passing_score)
`)
.order('started_at', { ascending: false });

// Get individual responses
.from('quiz_responses')
.select(`
  *,
  quiz_questions!quiz_responses_question_id_fkey(...)
`)
.eq('attempt_id', attemptId);
```

**Live Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Get active attempts
.from('quiz_attempts')
.select(`
  id, user_id, started_at,
  correct_answers, total_questions,
  profiles!quiz_attempts_user_id_fkey(username)
`)
.eq('is_completed', false);

// Count responses per attempt
.from('quiz_responses')
.select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
.eq('attempt_id', attemptId);
```

### Real-time Subscriptions

```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel('quiz_monitoring')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'quiz_attempts',
  }, () => loadActiveStudents())
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'INSERT',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'quiz_responses',
  }, () => loadActiveStudents())
  .subscribe();
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced refresh**: Not on every keystroke
- **Selective subscriptions**: Only relevant tables
- **Count queries**: Use `head: true` for efficiency
- **Pagination ready**: Can add later if needed
