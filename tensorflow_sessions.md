- Suitable for most straightforward architectures

**Model Architecture Components:**

**Layer 1: Input Layer (Dense)**

- One epoch = one pass through entire training dataset
- More epochs = more learning opportunities
- Too many epochs = risk of overfitting
- Monitor validation metrics to decide optimal number

**validation_data=(X_test, y_test)**
- Evaluates model on unseen data after each epoch
- Helps detect overfitting
- Different from test set (if available)
- Should not influence training

**Training History:**
