## üê≥ 1. Check the kubeconfig and Docker Config

This is the most likely reason it "just worked."

### Check Docker's Credential Helper

```bash
cat ~/.docker/config.json
```

You will almost certainly see the "credHelpers" section pointing to gcloud, which is what `gcloud auth configure-docker` sets up. This is the key to pulling private images seamlessly.

### Check kubectl's Current Context

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This will show you that the `*` is next to `docker-desktop`, meaning it was already correctly targeted.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Check for the Kubernetes Resources

These resources, once created, persist until the cluster is reset.

### Check for the Namespace

```bash
kubectl get namespace user-sessions
```

### Check for the Service Account

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccount terminal-controller --namespace user-sessions
```

### Check for the RBAC Permissions

```bash
kubectl get role terminal-pod-manager --namespace user-sessions
kubectl get rolebinding terminal-controller-binding --namespace user-sessions
```

### Check for an ImagePullSecret

It's possible your Mac was using the ImagePullSecret method we just implemented. You can check for it:

```bash
kubectl get secret gcr-cred --namespace user-sessions
```
